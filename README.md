🧠 Online Quiz Application

A secure, scalable, and user-friendly web application for conducting online quizzes with authentication, leaderboard integration, and role-based access control.

📘 About the Project

The Online Quiz Application is designed to provide a modern and secure platform for students to participate in assessments and quizzes digitally. It focuses on ensuring data integrity, fair assessment, and smooth accessibility for all users — students, administrators, and developers.

🔍 Problem Statement

Traditional quiz systems often suffer from weak authentication methods, lack of session management, and poor scalability. This project addresses these issues by introducing features such as:

Strong password (quiz code) encryption

Multi-factor authentication (Timer-based or OTP)

Secure session management (JWT/server-side tokens)

Role-based access control for students, admins, and super-admins

Integration with Google/GitHub for leaderboard and single sign-on

👥 Users & Stakeholders

Students: Participate in quizzes with secure login and progress tracking.

Administrators: Manage users, quiz categories, and monitor quiz logs.

Developers: Maintain performance, integrate APIs, and ensure security compliance.
